SALINE LEVEL TRACKER APP (FLUTTER AND FIREBASE) !!

PRIMARY GOAL:
A lot of patients died during the COVID Pandemic because of lack of staff in hospital to look at an individual. So we decided to come up with an app which would keep realtime track of
IV BAGS (SALINE BOTTLE) LEVEL for each bed in hospital and GIVE ALERTS when necessary....

SEE THIS IS A COMPLETE SOFTWARE + HARDWARE PROJECT:
1) HARDWARE SETUP: WE attached weight sensor to each of the stands where we would hang our Saline Bottle. Then we calibrated it as required and connected it with "NODE MCU" which is a WiFi Module
that transferred the REAL-TIME DATA, i.e., the real-time weight of the bottle, to the FIREBASE DATABASE.
3) SOFTWARE SETUP : WE developed a FLUTTER app with REALTIME UI UPDATES i.e, The level of the bottle for each bed updates in real-time and GIVES AN ALERT NOTIFICATION when the level reaches below a threshold value. We also added the LOGIN AND SIGNUP FUNCTIONALITY WITH AUTHENTICATION.

LEARNINGS:
FLUTTER STATE MANAGEMENT / FIREBASE / ANIMATION / AUTHENTICATION / NOTIFICATION ALERT

These are some sample images ! THE BOTTLE VIEW AND ANIMATION OF WATER-WAVE WAS A REAL CHALLENGE !
