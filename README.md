SALINE LEVEL TRACKER APP (FLUTTER AND FIREBASE) !!

PRIMARY GOAL:
A LOT OF PATIENTS DIED DURING THE COVID PANDEMIC BECAUSE OF LACK OF STAFF IN HOSPITAL TO LOOK AT AN INDIVIDUAL. SO WE DECIDED TO COME UP WITH AN APP WHICH WOULD KEEP 
REALTIME TRACK OF IV BAGS (SALINE BAGS) LEVEL FOR EACH BED IN HOSPITAL AND GIVE ALERTS WHEN NECESSARY...

SEE THIS IS A COMPLETE SOFTWARE + HARDWARE PROJECT:
1) HARDWARE SETUP: WE ATTACHED WEIGHT SENSOR TO EACH OF THE STANDS WHERE WE WOULD HANG OUR SALINE BOTTLE.THEN WE CALIBRATED IT AS REQUIRED AND CONNECTED IT
WITH "NODE MCU" WHICH IS A WIFI MODULE WHICH TRANSFERRED THE REALTIME DATA i.e THE REALTIME WEIGHT OF BOTTLE TO THE FIREBASE DATABASE.
2) SOFTWARE SETUP : WE DEVELOPED A FLUTTER APP WITH REALTIME UI UPDATES i.e, THE LEVEL OF BOTTLE FOR EACH BED UPDATES IN REALTIME AND GIVES AN ALERT NOTIFICATION
WHEN THE LEVEL REACHES BELOW A THRESHOLD VALUE. WE ALSO ADDED THE LOGIN AND SIGNUP FUNCTIONALITY WITH AUTHENTICATION.

LEARNINGS:
FLUTTER STATE MANAGEMENT / FIREBASE / ANIMATION / AUTHENTICATION / NOTIFICATION ALERT

THIS IS THE IMAGE OF HOW THE USER INTERFACE LOOKED LIKE ! THE BOTTLE VIEW AND ANIMATION OF WATER-WAVE WAS A REAL CHALLENGE !
